What is Software?
=================

A Software is a collection of Programs.
A Program is a collection of Instructions.



what is the difference between Product Vs Project?
==================================================

Product
=======

If Software Application is developed for multiple customers based on the Market requirement then it is called Product.


Project
=======

If Software Application is developed for specific customer based on his requirement then it is called Project.














SDLC
====

SDLC Stands for Software Development Life Cycle

What is meant by Software Development
=====================================

Software Development is the process of transforming Customer Requirements into a Complete Software Product.


Phases in SDLC 
==============
1.Requirements Gathering  (Planning)
2.Analysis
3.Design
4.Implementation    (Coding)
5.Testing
6.Deployment
7.Maintenance


SDLC Models
===========
1.Waterfall Model
2.Agile Model
3.V-Model 
4.Spiral Model
5.Prototype Model




Waterfall Model
===============

Waterfall model follows a linear sequential model of development  i.e until the first stage is not finished, the next stage will not start.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Agile Model
===========

Agile Model follows Iterative and Incremental approach.


Agile Principles
================

1.Customer no need to wait for long time.

2.We can accept / accommodate the requirement changes in the       middle of the Project.

3.We Develop , Test and Release as piece of software to the       customer with few number of features.

Let's take Example:  100 Requirements

First we will take one requirement then we will plan, design, Develop, Test and Release that requirement to the Client.

After Completion of the first requirement then only we will go for second requirement . Again in second requirement we will follow the same process (plan, design, Develop, Test and Release).

After completion of the second requirement we will go for the third requirement . again in third requirement we will follow the same process (plan, design, Develop, Test and Release).

                       .
		       .
                       .
                       .
                       .
                       .
                       ETC



Advantages of Agile
===================

1.Requirement changes are allowed or accommodate in any stage of    Development.

2.Release will be very Fast (2 weeks - 4 weeks).



Disadvantage of Agile
=====================

1.Less Design and Documentation.

SCRUM
=====
Scrum is a Framework through which we build software products by following the Agile principles.


Scrum includes group of people called as Scrum team which contains 4-8 people.


1.Product Owner
2.Scrum Master
3.Development Team
4.QA Team




1.Product Owner
===============

---> Who defines the features of the Product.
---> Prioritize features according to the market value.
---> Adjust feature and Priority in every iteration as needed.
---> Accept or Reject the work results.




2.Scrum Master
==============

---> The main role of Scrum Master is to drive the Agile process.




3&4. Dev & QA 
=============
 
---> Develop and Test the Software.


Scrum Terminologies
====================

1.User Story
2.EPIC
3.Product Backlog
4.Sprint
5.Sprint Planning Meeting
6.Sprint Backlog
7.Scrum Meeting
8.Sprint Retrospective Meeting
9.Story Point
10.Burndown Chart



1.User Story
============

---> A feature / Module of a Software.


2.EPIC
======

---> Collection of User Stories is called as EPIC.


3.Product Backlog
=================

---> Contains list of User Stories, prepared by the Product Owner.



4.Sprint
========

---> Period of time to complete the user stories, decided by the      Product Owner & Team (2 weeks - 4 weeks).



5.Sprint Planning Meeting
=========================

---> Meeting conducted with a team to define what can be delivered 
     in the sprint and duration of the sprint.



6.Sprint Backlog
================

---> List of committed Stories  by Dev / QA for specific sprints.



7.Scrum Meeting
===============

---> Meeting conducted by the Scrum Master everyday for 15 minutes      and also called as StandUp Call / Meeting / Scrum Call.



8.Sprint Retrospective Meeting
==============================

---> Conducts meeting after completion of sprint. The entire team       which includes both Scrum Master and Product Owner will            participate.


9.Story Point
=============

---> Rough Estimation of User Stories.


10.Burndown Chart
=================

---> Shows how much work remaining in the Sprint.
